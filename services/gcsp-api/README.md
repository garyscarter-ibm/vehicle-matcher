# GCSP API (Java 21 / Quarkus)

The separately built and deployed GCSP backend (FUCQ-454, contract in
[`docs/gcsp/migration-replacement-contracts-2026-11-13.md`](../../docs/gcsp/migration-replacement-contracts-2026-11-13.md)).
It runs no Node code. This first slice provides the JVM artifact, external configuration, readiness, graceful
shutdown and `GET /api/gcsp/v1/context`.

## Pinned versions

| Tool | Version | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Java | 21 (release 21; enforcer requires `[21,22)`) | Agreed target (Q03). Built and run locally on Homebrew OpenJDK 21.0.13. |
| Quarkus platform | 3.40.1.2 | Latest patch of the current 3.40 LTS stream (3.33 is the previous LTS). Quarkus 4 is pre-release. |
| Maven | 3.9.16 via the committed wrapper (`mvnw`, wrapper 3.3.4, script-only) | Latest 3.9.x; SHA-256 of the distribution is pinned in `.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.properties`. |
| Build plugins | compiler 3.15.0, surefire 3.5.6, enforcer 3.7.0 | Explicit, so a host's Maven defaults cannot change the build. |
| Container base | `eclipse-temurin:21.0.13_9-jdk-noble` / `-jre-noble`, pinned by digest | Render has no native Java runtime, so it builds `Dockerfile`. |

`project.build.outputTimestamp` is fixed, so two builds of one commit give byte-identical `target/quarkus-app/`.
No BMW build or container standards have been supplied yet (Q22); reconcile them here when Gary provides them.

## Build, test and run

```sh
export JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@21   # any JDK 21
./mvnw -B verify                                  # tests and the fast-jar in target/quarkus-app/
PORT=8080 java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
curl -s localhost:8080/q/health/ready
curl -s localhost:8080/api/gcsp/v1/context        # 401 JSON: no bearer token
```

Copy the whole `target/quarkus-app/` directory to deploy; `quarkus-run.jar` needs its `lib/` beside it. SIGTERM
drains in-flight requests for up to `GCSP_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT`, then exits. The container image is
`docker build -t gcsp-api services/gcsp-api`.

## Configuration (environment variables)

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | `8080` | HTTP port (Render injects it). Binds `0.0.0.0`. |
| `GCSP_IDENTITY_PROVIDER` | `none` | Identity port. `none` refuses every context call. Unknown values stop startup. |
| `GCSP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | empty | Exact CORS origins, comma separated. Empty means same-origin only. FUCQ-435 sets the deployed value. |
| `GCSP_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` | `10s` | Graceful shutdown drain limit. |
| `JAVA_OPTS` | `-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75` (image) | JVM options for the container start command. |

No secret is read yet. Database, OIDC and mail settings arrive with FUCQ-455, FUCQ-456 and FUCQ-469.

## Endpoints

| Path | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /q/health/ready` | Readiness, including the selected identity provider. Render's health check. |
| `GET /q/health/live` | Liveness. |
| `GET /api/gcsp/v1/context` | `{"status":"ok","value":{subject,roles,environmentId,runId,employeeId?,policyVersion,capabilities}}` |

Every other path, and every refusal, is a JSON body `{status, code, reason, retryable}` (500s add a
`reference`), never HTML. Context refusals: no or non-Bearer `Authorization` gives 401 `bearer-missing` or
`bearer-invalid`; a rejected token gives 401; a valid but unmapped subject gives 403 `subject-not-mapped`; no
configured provider gives 503 `identity-provider-not-configured`.

## Identity seam (for FUCQ-455)

`gcsp.api.identity.IdentityPort` resolves a bearer token to an `IdentityResult`: `Resolved(Principal)`,
`Rejected` (401), `Unmapped` (403) or `Unavailable` (503). `IdentitySelection` picks one implementation at startup
from `gcsp.identity.provider`:

- `none` (default, every profile): `UnconfiguredIdentity`, refuses all tokens.
- `fixed-test`: `FixedTestIdentity`, one configured token and principal. Startup fails unless Quarkus is in
  test launch mode, so no deployed profile can serve a synthetic employee.

FUCQ-455 adds an `oidc` case to `IdentitySelection.select` that validates signature, issuer, audience and lifetime,
then maps trusted issuer/subject to a principal, returning `Unmapped` for an unknown subject.

## Render

Gary's dev environment does not exist yet. The proposed service block for `render.gcsp.yaml` is in
[`render-service.proposed.yaml`](render-service.proposed.yaml); GC is the single writer for the blueprint.
